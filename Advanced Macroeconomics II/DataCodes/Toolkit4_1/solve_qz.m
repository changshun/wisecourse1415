% SOLVE_QZ.M is called by SOLVE.M, provided the option DO_QZ = 1 has been set.
% SOLVE_QZ.M employs the QZ-method, due to C.A. Sims (1989, 1996)
% and P. Klein (1997), adapted to the method of undetermined coefficients
% The QZ-method is perhaps numerically more stable than the generalized
% eigenvalue method employed in the standard solve algorithm.
% More importantly, the QZ-method works, even if PP is
% not diagonalizable.
% SOLVE_QZ.M in turn makes use of the routines
% QZDIV.M and QZSWITCH.M, written by C.A. Sims (1996).
%
% Once the PP matrix has been obtained, SOLVE_QZ proceeds
% to solve for the other matrices in the same way as SOLVE.M.

% Theory: with the matrix definitions in the paper,
% find the QZ-decomposition for Delta and Xi, i.e.
% unitary matrices U and V and upper triangular matrices
% Delta_up and Xi_up so that
% U * Delta * V = Delta_up
% U * Xi * V = Xi_up
% and such that the ratios of the diagonal entries
% | Xi_up(i,i) / Delta_up(i,i) | are ordered ascendingly.
% Let U[a,b] be the m x m submatrices of U, where a,b = 1,2
% and likewise for V', where V' is the complex conjugate transpose.
% If V'[2,1] and U[2,1] are invertible
% then it can be shown that P = - inv(V'[2,1])*V'[2,2]
% is a solution to the matrix quadratic equation with
% the most stable roots selected.
% A problem that this version of the program does not
% yet solve is to drop a low real eigenvalue, if otherwise
% two conjugate complex roots are separated.
