% VERSION 4.1, MAY 2003, COPYRIGHT H. UHLIG.
%   May 2003: QZ-algorithm is know the default solution method.
%
% OPTIONS.M sets the options to be used in all the subroutines.
% It is called by DO_IT.M.  If you use any of the routines
% "by hand", i.e. without calling them via DO_IT.M, you also
% have to execute OPTIONS.M first.
% If you want to change some options, change them here.
%
% Some options can also set directly inside the programs: they are then not overwritten
% here.  They are only set here to their default values, if they have not been set previously.
% Of course, if you didn't set them inside the program, but they have been set by
% a previous program, which you have executed before, then the values set by this
% previous program will not be overwritten either and thus used.  I.e. IT IS GENERALLY A
% GOOD IDEA TO TYPE CLEAR BEFORE RUNNING YOUR PROGRAM  SO THAT THE OPTIONS WILL ALWAYS BE
% SET THE WAY YOU WANT THEM TO.  Alternatively, if you have run your program once,
% just change some options, and rerun the calculations by typing do_it
%
% The options, which can be set within a program or by hand, are, 
% together with their default values:
%
%       IT IS BAD STYLE NOT TO SET THESE OPTIONS WITHIN YOUR PROGRAM:
%   PERIOD     = 4;    % number of periods per year, i.e. 12 for monthly, 4 for quarterly
