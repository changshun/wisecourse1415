% VERSION 4.1, MAY 2003, COPYRIGHT H. UHLIG.
%   May 2003: major correction: autocorrelation calculation interchanged lags and leads before,
%      due to overlooking, that for complex vectors v, say, v' is the complex-conjugate transpose,
%      not just the transpose.  This has now been corrected.
%      Thanks goes to Mathias Trabandt for pointing out the error.
%      
% MOMENTS.M calculates variances, covariances, and autocorrelation 
% tables, using frequency domain techniques with and without HP-Filtering.
% It is assumed that the endogeneous state variables x(t), the other endogenous
% variables y(t) and the exogeneous state variables z(t) obey the law of motion
% x(t) = PP x(t-1) + QQ z(t),
% y(t) = RR x(t-1) + SS z(t),
% z(t) = NN z(t-1) + epsilon(t), VAR(epsilon(t)) = Sigma,
% It is assumed that the matrix WW with the property
% [x(t)',y(t)',z(t)']' = WW [x(t)', z(t)']' has been calculated with e.g. SOLVE.M.
% The program concentrates on 
% v' = [ x(t)' y(t)' z(t)' ]'(HP_SELECT),
% where HP_SELECT can be chosen to restrict attention to desired variables
% or to reorder them so that e.g. GNP is at the top.
%
% The following options need be chosen beforehand:
% PERIOD: number of periods per year (e.g. = 12 for monthly, = 4 for quarterly)
% HP_SELECT: A vector selecting the variables for which the computations should be
%     performed.  HP_SELECT = 1: (m+n+k) selects all variables.
% GNP_INDEX:  The autocorrelation table is calculated with respect to v(GNP_INDEX).
%     If GNP_INDEX is the index of GNP in vector, the autocorrelation table will provide
%     information about the correlations of the variables with leads and lags of GNP.
%     Note that GNP_INDEX must be the index of GNP in the vector v, which just
%     contains a subset of all variables, if HP_SELECT is not equal to 1: (m+n+k).
% 
% The program provides the following results, both for the unfiltered, ``raw'' series 
% (extension: _raw) as well as for the HP-filtered series (extension: _fil).  For example,
% covmat_raw is the contemporaneous covariance matrix for the unfiltered series, whereas
% covmat_fil is the contemporaneous covariance matrix for the filtered series.  The computed
% variables (without extension) are:
%
%  autcov:  matrix-autocovariance function, autcov(j+1,:) = E[v(t) * v(t-j)'], columnwise vectorized.
%  covmat: contemporaneous covariance matrix
%  cor: Vector of instantaneous correlations of v(t) with v(t,GNP_INDEX);
%  autcor: autcor_fil(N_LEADS_LAGS + j,:) is the correlation of v(t+j) with v(t,GNP_INDEX),
%        where v is HP-filtered (autcor_raw similar for unfiltered v).  Leaders have negative j.
%        The last row indicates the lag j. This is the autocorrelation table often used in the RBC literature.
%  au1mat: = E[v(t) * v(t-1)'], i.e. the matrix of first-order autocovariances.  Useful for calculating regressions.
%  varvec: vector of the variances, i.e. the diagonal of covmat
%
% Other variables that are computed, thus possibly overwriting variables in use with the same
% name are:
% m_states, n_endog, k_exog, n_select, WW_sel, freqs, svv_raw, svv_fil,  hp, grdpt, im, z, zi, ss, ssd 
% gnp_select, diag_select, cov0_raw, cov0_fil, autcor1_raw, autcor1_fil,
% autcor2_raw, autcor2_fil, leadslags
