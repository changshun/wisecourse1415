% SOLVE.M solves for the decision rules in a linear system,
% which is assumed to be of the form
% 0 = AA x(t) + BB x(t-1) + CC y(t) + DD z(t)
% 0 = E_t [ FF x(t+1) + GG x(t) + HH x(t-1) + JJ y(t+1) + KK y(t) + LL z(t+1) + MM z(t)]
% z(t+1) = NN z(t) + epsilon(t+1) with E_t [ epsilon(t+1) ] = 0,
% where it is assumed that x(t) is the endogenous state vector,
% y(t) the other endogenous variables and z(t) the exogenous state
% vector.  It is assumed that the row dimension of AA is at least as large as
% the dimensionality of the endogenous state vector x(t).  
% The program solves for the equilibrium law of motion
% x(t) = PP x(t-1) + QQ z(t)
% y(t) = RR x(t-1) + SS z(t).
% To use this program, define the matrices AA, BB, .., NN.
% SOLVE.M then calculates PP.   
% 
% A few additional variables are used
% overwriting variables with the same names
% that might have been used before.  They are:
% sumimag, sumabs, message, warnings, CC_plus, CC_0, Psi_mat, Gamma_mat, Theta_mat, Xi_mat,
% Delta_mat, Xi_eigvec, Xi_eigval, Xi_sortabs, Xi_sortindex, Xi_sortvec, Xi_sortval,
% Xi_select, drop_index, Omega_mat, Lambda_mat, PP_imag, VV, LLNN_plus_MM, QQSS_vec

% This update includes the suggestion by Andrew Atkeson to use generalized
% eigenvalues to perform the computations.  IN PARTICULAR, THE DEFINITION OF
% PSI_MAT, GAMMA_MAT and THETA_MAT have been changed!
% Furthermore, there is an option to use the QZ-method, due to Sims (1989, 1996)
% instead.  You can activate it by setting DO_QZ = 1;
%
% You can also select roots manually.  For the manual selection procedure,

      %  MANUAL SELECTION OF ROOTS PROCEDURE.  INSTRUCTIONS:     %
      % For manual selection, set MANUAL_ROOTS = 1 and %
      % define Xi_manual somewhere earlier in your calculations. %
      % Xi_manual should be a vector of length m_states with     %
      % distinct integer entries between 1 and 2*m_states. The   %
      % program then uses the roots Xi_sortval(Xi_manual) and    %
      % the corresponding eigenvectors Xi_sortvec(Xi_manual).    %
      % Thus, to choose the desired roots, run the program once  %
      % with automatic root selection, take a look at Xi_sortval,%
      % and Xi_sortvec and write down the indices of the desired %  
      % roots.                                                   %
