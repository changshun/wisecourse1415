% Farmer, R.E.A. and J.T. Guo, "Real Business Cycles and the 
% Animal Spirits Hypothesis," Journal of Economic Theory 63, 42-72 (1994).
% You can choose the model by setting FARMER_GUO = 1, 2 or 3.
% The default is FARMER_GUO = 3 to show the failure.
% 
% First, parameters are set and the steady state is calculated. Next, the matrices are
% declared.  In the last line, the model is solved and analyzed by calling DO_IT.M
